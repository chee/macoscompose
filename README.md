# .macoscompose

this lets you write compose key config in a simple yaml-like format.

the setup is just like that on
[gnarf's osx-compose-key repo](https://github.com/gnarf/osx-compose-key) except
you don't need to download or install it, instead you can make a `.macoscompose`
file in your `$HOME` and populate it in a manner similar to this:

```yaml
+1: ğŸ‘
-1: ğŸ‘

# hearts
heart: â¤
"yellow heart": ğŸ’›

dog: ğŸ¶
"(:": í ½í¹ƒ
```

then run `node .` in this directory (once you've `npm install`'d) and restart
the apps you want to use compose key in.

## something like this:

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/chee/macoscompose
cd macoscompose
cp example.macoscompose ~/.macoscompose
npm install
node .
```
